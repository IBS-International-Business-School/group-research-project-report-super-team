## Executive Summary

Evident growth of e-commerce (Karl, 2024) has increased the scope of strategies to attract customers and boost sales. Among many strategies and tools, product presentation style remains as a major consumer behavior factor (Musyarrofah, 2024). Our research focused on perception analysis of two presentation styles in ecommerce, studio and lifestyle images, to help VistaCommerce company, a global software that provides online retailers with design and optimization tools and mainly operates in fashion, home goods, and cosmetics industries. To assist company’s clients in choosing between two styles, our team conducted A/B test using a product from fashion sector (glasses) and a home goods product (lamp). The main aim of the research was to examine the relationship between image style and consumers' engagement, perceived trust, and purchase intent and provide applicable insights towards decision-making of VistaCommerce company.
 
Based on the results of A/B test, lifestyle images outperformed studio pictures in terms of engagement and purchase intent, while studio images demonstrated more trust to participants. Therefore, the analysis suggests implementing a dual-image strategy that can enable consumers to have both view of trust and engagement. 

## Introduction

Online shopping is becoming more frequent and valuable as a result of the growth in the number of people using the Internet on a daily basis. Consequently, majority of the companies pay more attention to the pictures of products to advertise on their websites. This study aims to examine how different product image styles influence user perceptions in an online shopping context, with a specific focus on determining whether lifestyle imagery provides measurable advantages over traditional studio photography. The goal is to assess whether lifestyle images lead to higher perceived Engagement and whether they improve purchase-related perceptions two constructs that play a central role in online decision-making. To evaluate these effects, two hypothesis tests were conducted using controlled A/B survey experiments.

For Hypothesis Test 1, we investigated the construct of Engagement, guided by the research question: “Do lifestyle product images increase perceived engagement compared to studio images?” The null hypothesis (H₀) stated that lifestyle images do not increase perceived engagement, while the alternative hypothesis (H₁) proposed that they do increase engagement.

For Hypothesis Test 2, we examined purchase-related perceptions, specifically Trust and Purchase Intent, based on the research question: “Do lifestyle product images improve purchase-related perceptions?” The null hypothesis (H₀) stated that lifestyle images do not improve Trust or Purchase Intent, while the alternative hypothesis (H₁) proposed that they do enhance these perceptions.

## Methodology 

The data collection was executed via two survey variants, A and B, distributed among accessible communities (university, workplace, online communities, etc.) through a platform which simulates A/B test control environment by evenly redirecting respondents to one of the surveys[nimblelinks.com]. This approach was a pragmatic alternative to utilizing a live retailer platform, prioritizing internal validity by isolating the image style as the sole manipulated variable while measuring operationalized metrics using Likert scales. To control for the inherent product bias, two distinct product categories- a table lamp (home goods) and sunglasses (fashion)- were assessed. The use of dual products allowed for an evaluation of whether visual perception effects vary significantly across product categories. To ensure the observed effects were due to image style and not item preference, two products were used. This approach provides data to quantify and mitigate the influence of inherent product liking, despite the controls put in place, such as being asked to assume the product fits their preferences.

The assessment itself was streamlined, utilizing six focused rating statements per product on a 5-point scale (1= Strongly Disagree to 5= Strongly Agree) to ensure high completion rates with shorter and faster surveys. These statements measured three core factors: Engagement (E-1: attention capture, E-2: imaginative ownership), Perceived Trust (PT-1: confidence in real-life appearance, PT-2: reliability perception), and Purchase Intent (PI-1: motivation to seek price/reviews, PI-2: likelihood of selection). 

Each construct was measured using two statements, and we calculated the final scores for Engagement (E), Perceived Trust (PT), and Purchase Intent (PI) by taking the average of those two items. This gave us a single score per construct, which kept things simple while still being reliable for comparing the two image styles.

Demographically, gender was included as a control variable due to its established influence in visual perception studies. Geographic data collected both nationality and country of greatest exposure to capture the cultural context underlying trust and aspiration. Furthermore, the Age options were specifically granulated in the 18–29 range (18–20, 21–24, 25–29) to be statistically optimal for the primary accessible community (university students and young professionals). This finer split was essential for observing nuanced shifts in response within a life stage (e.g., first job, increased disposable income) highly relevant to the study of aspirational e-commerce imagery.

To check whether image style made a difference, we applied several statistical tests. First, we ran independent-samples t-tests to compare Version A (studio images) and Version B (lifestyle images) for each construct. We also used paired-samples t-tests to see whether people rated the Lamp and the Glasses differently within the same image condition. In addition, we conducted one-way ANOVAs to explore whether demographics such as: Gender, Age, Nationality, and Most Exposed Country (MEC) affected the results. All tests used a significance level of p < 0.05.

## Results  

Lifestyle imagery produced several notable effects on participant perceptions across Engagement, Trust, and Purchase Intent, although these effects varied by product type. Overall, Version B tended to increase Engagement and make the images appear clearer, while Version A maintained a slight advantage in perceived Trustworthiness.

For H1 (Engagement), lifestyle images did make a noticeable difference, but only for the Glasses. The engagement score for the glasses in Version B was significantly higher (p = 0.0246), which means that for this product the alternative hypothesis is supported. However, for the Lamp, even though engagement was still a little higher under the lifestyle version, it wasn’t statistically significant. Because only one of the two products reached significance, we can only partially reject H₀. So, lifestyle photos do seem to help with engagement, but not consistently enough across products to fully confirm H₁.

For H2 (Trust + Purchase Intent), the results didn’t give us statistical support. Purchase Intent was slightly better under lifestyle images, but not by enough to count as significant. Trust actually leaned a bit higher for studio images, which suggests that the simple, clean background still gives people more confidence about what the product really looks like. Since both Trust and Purchase Intent had p-values above 0.05, we cannot reject H₂, even though the lifestyle images did show a positive trend for clarity.

We also noticed something else that wasn’t directly tied to the image style: Lamps tended to be rated better than Glasses overall. In Version A (studio style), lamps scored higher for Engagement, Trust, and Purchase Intent. In Version B (lifestyle style), lamps again scored higher for Trust and Purchase Intent, but the Engagement difference wasn’t significant this time. This suggests there is some natural product bias happening, meaning people simply liked the lamp more regardless of which photo style it was shown in.

Finally, the demographic tests showed only small effects. Gender and “Most Exposed Country” had an influence on Purchase Intent, but Age and Nationality didn’t make a significant difference. This tells us that while certain backgrounds can affect how easily someone interprets a product image, the general patterns of our results don’t change much across different groups.

In short, lifestyle images seem especially helpful for improving engagement (at least for certain products), while studio images still appear slightly more trustworthy. The results line up with partial support for H₁ and no support for H₂, and they highlight that the “best” type of image depends a lot on what product is being shown.

Meanwhile, the blue bars (Version A) remain marginally higher for Trust, reflecting the credibility advantage of the studio-style imagery.

## Discussion

According to Li, Wang and Chen (2014), product images are one of the primary channels for online consumers to assess the quality and the design of the products. Moreover, it has been also examined that pictures containing social presence signals, especially human models, not only tend to increase customer’s trust and intention to purchase but also, appearance of human images would make brand websites more trustworthy. However, based on our survey results, even though life-style pictures outperformed across most concepts specially for engagement and Purchase Intent, trust score was slightly higher for studio images. For both products, participants rated studio-styled images more trustworthy than lifestyle images. Therefore, the reason behind this uncorrelation could be related to the quality of pictures or the type of the product. In fact, studio images would provide clearer presentations which would satisfy customers from the quality point of view.

On the other hand, Maier and Dost (2018) cited as opposed to a plain white backgrounds, product images with a fitting contextual background contributes to consumers mental imaginary and helps them to engage more with the product. Furthermore, images with plain backgrounds do not provide necessary clues regarding how it would fit or how consumers can utilize it. In fact, this would give customers a chance to have a clear understanding of size, shape and function. Accordingly, a report (Komolov, 2025) conducted to analyze the reason for high return rates also suggests that one of the primary reasons for high returns is incorrect expectations regarding size, fitness and quality. Therefore, using life-style images would minimize such risks of these cases. According to Wang et al. (2021), product photos that contains dynamic or rich-context can help buyers visualize the product more widely, which can contribute to their purchase intention. In addition, Kim and Sullivan (2019) claim that consumers are more likely to engage with a brand when its visual presentation stimulates emotions and experiences. Since lifestyle images let buyers have an imaginary view of the products, they usually generate more engagement than simple studio photos. These findings would support the results of our survey in which both products had higher votes for lifestyle images compared to studio images. 

Furthermore, there were some limitations that it is worth noting. Firstly, time scope was very short therefore sample size stayed relatively small. The age group mostly ranged between 21-29 and no answer received for people over 39 which means the results may not fully reflect all the online shoppers. Moreover, only two different products were presented, however, the results might not apply for all product categories. Having more time range and resources could give us a chance to test more items and collect more balanced and wide responses.

There are also some potential biases to be considered. Since the survey was based on self-reported opinions, the results might not be same for actual purchasing activity. People usually act differently on purchasing websites than what they answer on questionnaires. Furthermore, participants have different preferences for products regardless of the image styles. 

Besides biases and limitations, we had some challenges as well. The primary challenge could be not being able to test our survey on a real website that would have provided more accurate data. Finding participants from different demographics and age groups was another challenge. The majority of the participants were from Hungary or Azerbaijan and between 21-29 ages, which had an impact on the sample's diversity.  

## Recommendations 

In conclusion, product image styles have a significant impact on customer intentions. The average scores for engagement and purchase intent were higher for lifestyle photos. Therefore, lifestyle images help buyers visualize it better, comprehend their dimensions or function, and feel more secure about their assessment. While age, nationality, and geographic location did not significantly affect the results, gender was the only demographic factor that had a significant impact where female respondents had higher overall purchase intention. 

Based on the findings, several recommendations could be made for e-commerce businesses. Firstly, since lifestyle images help customers to establish more realistic expectations, retailers should give priority to having lifestyle photos in addition to studio pictures. Secondly, lifestyle images can be especially helpful for products where their dimensions or use is not immediately apparent. This can help to minimize customer confusion and possible returns.

## Reflection on Team Process 

We successfully used collaborative features of GitHub including branch creations, pull requests, merging, issue creation, assigining, and closing. Teamwork and collaboration went smoothly with team members being equally involved and supportive of each other. We implemented Agile methodologies by having sprint meetings where we distributed our roles, goals, and deadlines and documented them. We had quick standups/calls where we solved bottlenecks and iterated our plans. Before first call, we agreed to do literature review on the topic individually and during the call we distributed research report sections we are responsible for. However, after the call, we noticed that the writing cannot be coordinated well before we designed the survey and collected data, hence there was another call organized during which we did iteration of our plans and redistributed tasks according to both functions and writing sections. Akmaral took responsibility for survey designing, writing methodology section, guiding the GitHub use, as well as documenting and guiding the team process. The analysis and writing results were agreed to be taken by Atilla. While Aydan helped to finish writing the report, collecting references, finalizing the document and preparing presentation slides.
