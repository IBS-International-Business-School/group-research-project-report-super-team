## Declaration
[ChatGPT 5.0] was used to [brainstorm themes and structure] for this group research project report on [topic]. Prompt: '...' No AI-generated text is included in the final submission. Accessed: [Date]. Available at: https://chat.openai.com/.

We have retained a complete set of raw data, including questionnaires (papers completed by hand or record downloaded from the online survey platform), recordings, and/or transcripts of interviews, secondary data, etc., as well as data analysis files and documents. 

## Executive Summary  [_A concise overview of the business problem, research objectives, key findings, and actionable recommendations. This section should be no longer than 250 words and written so that a decision-maker could understand the main outcomes without reading the full report._]
...


## Introduction [_Clearly define your research question, hypothesis (for A/B testing), or objective (for survey research)_]

(AYDAN)
### Case

### Literature Review


## Methodology [_For survey research, describe the survey design, sampling method, and data collection process. For A/B testing, explain the experiment setup, control/treament groups, and metrics for evaluation_]

The data collection was executed via two survey variants, A and B, distributed among accessible communities (university, workplace, online communities, etc.) through a platform which simulates A/B test control environment by evenly redirecting respondents to one of the surveys[nimblelinks.com]. This approach was a pragmatic alternative to utilizing a live retailer platform, prioritizing internal validity by isolating the image style as the sole manipulated variable while measuring operationalized metrics using Likert scales. To control for the inherent product bias, two distinct product categories—a table lamp (home goods) and sunglasses (fashion)—were assessed. The use of dual products allowed for an evaluation of whether visual perception effects vary significantly across product categories. To ensure the observed effects were due to image style and not item preference, two products were used. This approach provides data to quantify and mitigate the influence of inherent product liking, despite the controls put in place, such as being asked to assume the product fits their preferences.

The assessment itself was streamlined, utilizing six focused rating statements per product on a 5-point scale (1 = Strongly Disagree to 5 = Strongly Agree) to ensure high completion rates with shorter and faster survey. These statements measured three core factors: Engagement (E-1: attention capture, E-2: imaginative ownership), Perceived Trust (PT-1: confidence in real-life appearance, PT-2: reliability perception), and Purchase Intent (PI-1: motivation to seek price/reviews, PI-2: likelihood of selection). 

Demographically, gender was included as a control variable due to its established influence in visual perception studies. Geographic data collected both nationality and country of greatest exposure to capture the cultural context underlying trust and aspiration. Furthermore, the Age options were specifically granulated in the 18–29 range (18–20, 21–24, 25–29) to be statistically optimal for the primary accessible community (university students and young professionals). This finer split was essential for observing nuanced shifts in response within a life stage (e.g., first job, increased disposable income) highly relevant to the study of aspirational e-commerce imagery.


## Results  [_Present and analyse the data collected using appropriate statistical or analytical methods. Include relevant data visualizations and explain their significance_]

(ATILLA)


## Discussion [_Synthesize your results, citing min. five (5) sources and authors; discuss the implications of your findings; and critically assess the research. Address any limitations, biases, or challenges faced_]

Implications of the findings:

Limitations:
- Time 
- Respondents demographics
- 
Biases:
- Self-reported opinions may not reflect actual behavior
- Product biases instead of image style
- 
Challenges faced:
- No active retail shop website to implement original A/B test
- Getting wider sample of respondents with differing backgrounds
- 


## Recommendations  [_Summarise the key insights from the project and suggest specific, actionable business or real-world applications. Where relevant, prioritise your recommendations and explain their expected impact_]

Key insights:

Actionable business or real-world applications:

Recommendations and their expected impact:


## Reflection on Team Process  [_Briefly reflect on how your team applied Agile principles during the project, including sprint planning, stand-ups, and retrospectives. Comment on any challenges encountered, how they were addressed, and notable successes in your collaboration_]

(it's just a draft version) We had sprint planning and stand-up calls. Before first call, we have agreed to do literature review on the topic indvidually and during the call we distributed research report sections we are responsible for. However, soon enough after the call, we noticed that the writing cannot be coordinated well before we design the survey and collect data, hence there was another call organized during which we did iteration of our plans and redistributed tasks according to both functions and writing sections. Akmaral took responsibility for designing the survey, writing methodology section, guiding the github use, as well as documenting the team process. The function of performing the analysis and writing results was agreed to be taken by Atilla. Aydan's responsibilities remained similar as she was responsible for Introduction section writing, actively promoting survey, preparing presentation file (?). Discussion and recommendations sections agreed to work together on(?).

Submission Guidelines
Word Count. The main body of the report should be between 1,800 and 2,200 words, excluding code snippets, tables, and data visualizations. Reports outside this range lose 10 points from the final mark. Reports below 1,600 words are rejected.
Minimum Credible Five Sources Over and Beyond Those Assigned in Class. Your report must reference at least five credible sources to support your research and analysis, preferably, related to the subject of your research.

Your group project will be assessed according to the following criteria, which are directly aligned with the intended learning outcomes:
Markdown Proficiency [20%]. Effective use of Markdown format for organizing and presenting project documentation. Includes structure, clarity, use of tables, lists, and code blocks (as applicable).
Use of Collaborative Tools and Agile Methodologies [20%]. Demonstration of effective use of GitHub for collaboration, including branching, pull requests, and issue tracking. Evidence of applying Agile methodologies (e.g., sprint planning, retrospectives) and documentation of these processes.
Data Synthesis and Critical Analysis [30%]. Quality and depth of data analysis. Ability to critically evaluate data and draw meaningful conclusions. Discussion of biases, limitations, and challenges.
