## Declaration
[ChatGPT 5.0] was used to [brainstorm themes and structure] for this group research project report on [topic]. Prompt: '...' No AI-generated text is included in the final submission. Accessed: [Date]. Available at: https://chat.openai.com/.

We have retained a complete set of raw data, including questionnaires (papers completed by hand or record downloaded from the online survey platform), recordings, and/or transcripts of interviews, secondary data, etc., as well as data analysis files and documents.

## Methodology
The experimental methodology was executed via two survey variants, A and B, distributed among accessible communities(university,workplace,random,etc) through an online platform which simulates A/B test control environment by evenly redirecting respondents to one of the surveys[nimblelinks.com]. This approach was a pragmatic alternative to utilizing a live retailer platform, prioritizing internal validity by isolating the image style as the sole manipulated variable while measuring operationalized metrics using Likert scales. To control for the inherent product bias, two distinct product categories—a table lamp (home goods) and sunglasses (fashion)—were assessed. The use of dual products allowed for an evaluation of whether visual perception effects vary significantly across product categories, with both products presented identically across all non-image variables. Although respondents were asked to assume favorable conditions (design fit, fair price) to control for confounding variables, two different products were used to obtain richer results that account for, and potentially isolate, the residual effect of product-specific bias.

The assessment itself was streamlined, utilizing only six focused rating statements per product on a 5-point scale (1 = Strongly Disagree to 5 = Strongly Agree) to ensure high completion rates. These statements measured three core factors: Engagement (E-1: attention capture, E-2: imaginative ownership), Perceived Trust (PT-1: confidence in real-life appearance, PT-2: reliability perception), and Purchase Intent (PI-1: motivation to seek price/reviews, PI-2: likelihood of selection). 

Demographically, gender was included as a control variable due to its established influence in visual perception studies. Geographic data collected both nationality and country of greatest exposure to capture the cultural context underlying trust and aspiration. Furthermore, the Age options were specifically granulated in the 18–29 range (18–20, 21–24, 25–29) to be statistically optimal for the primary accessible community (university students and young professionals). This finer split was essential for observing nuanced shifts in response within a life stage (e.g., first job, increased disposable income) highly relevant to the study of aspirational e-commerce imagery.
