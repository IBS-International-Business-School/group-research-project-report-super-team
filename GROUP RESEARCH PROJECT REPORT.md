## Executive Summary  [_A concise overview of the business problem, research objectives, key findings, and actionable recommendations. This section should be no longer than 250 words and written so that a decision-maker could understand the main outcomes without reading the full report._]

Evident growth of e-commerce (Karl, 2024) has increased the scope of strategies to attract customers and boost sales. Among many strategies and tools, product presentation style remains as a major consumer behavior factor (Musyarrofah, 2024). However, there are several styles existing in this field, and all require complex consumer analysis. Our research focused on perception analysis of two presentation styles in ecommerce, studio and lifestyle images, to help VistaCommerce company, a global software that provides online retailers with design and optimisation tools and mainly operates in fashion, home goods, and cosmetics industries. In order to assist company’s clients in choosing between two styles, our team conducted A/B test using a product from fashion sector (glasses) and a home goods product (lamp). 

The main aim of the research was to examine the relationship between image style and consumers' engagement, perceived trust, and purchase intent and provide applicable insights towards decision-making of VistaCommerce company.

## Introduction [_Clearly define your research question, hypothesis (for A/B testing), or objective (for survey research)_]

Online shopping is becoming more frequent and valuable as a result of the growth in the number of people using the Internet on a daily basis. Consequently, majority of the companies pay more attention to the pictures of products to advertise on their websites. However, nowadays picture styles have became more complex and require a deeper understanding of human psychology. This study aims to examine how different product image styles influence user perceptions in an online shopping context, with a specific focus on determining whether lifestyle imagery provides measurable advantages over traditional studio photography. The goal is to assess whether lifestyle images lead to higher perceived Engagement and whether they improve purchase-related perceptions two constructs that play a central role in online decision-making. To evaluate these effects, two hypothesis tests were conducted using controlled A/B survey experiments.

For Hypothesis Test 1, we investigated the construct of Engagement, guided by the research question: “Do lifestyle product images increase perceived engagement compared to studio images?” The null hypothesis (H₀) stated that lifestyle images do not increase perceived engagement, while the alternative hypothesis (H₁) proposed that they do increase engagement.

For Hypothesis Test 2, we examined purchase-related perceptions, specifically Trust and Information Clarity, based on the research question: “Do lifestyle product images improve purchase-related perceptions?” The null hypothesis (H₀) stated that lifestyle images do not improve Trust or Information Clarity, while the alternative hypothesis (H₁) proposed that they do enhance these perceptions.

## Methodology [_For survey research, describe the survey design, sampling method, and data collection process. For A/B testing, explain the experiment setup, control/treament groups, and metrics for evaluation_]

The data collection was executed via two survey variants, A and B, distributed among accessible communities (university, workplace, online communities, etc.) through a platform which simulates A/B test control environment by evenly redirecting respondents to one of the surveys[nimblelinks.com]. This approach was a pragmatic alternative to utilizing a live retailer platform, prioritizing internal validity by isolating the image style as the sole manipulated variable while measuring operationalized metrics using Likert scales. To control for the inherent product bias, two distinct product categories—a table lamp (home goods) and sunglasses (fashion)—were assessed. The use of dual products allowed for an evaluation of whether visual perception effects vary significantly across product categories. To ensure the observed effects were due to image style and not item preference, two products were used. This approach provides data to quantify and mitigate the influence of inherent product liking, despite the controls put in place, such as being asked to assume the product fits their preferences.

The assessment itself was streamlined, utilizing six focused rating statements per product on a 5-point scale (1 = Strongly Disagree to 5 = Strongly Agree) to ensure high completion rates with shorter and faster survey. These statements measured three core factors: Engagement (E-1: attention capture, E-2: imaginative ownership), Perceived Trust (PT-1: confidence in real-life appearance, PT-2: reliability perception), and Purchase Intent (PI-1: motivation to seek price/reviews, PI-2: likelihood of selection). 

Each construction was measured using two statements, and the final scores for Engagement (E), Perceived Trust (PT), and Information Clarity (IC) were computed by taking the arithmetic mean of the two corresponding items. This averaging approach yields a single, composite score per construct, improving reliability while maintaining simplicity for between-group comparisons.

Demographically, gender was included as a control variable due to its established influence in visual perception studies. Geographic data collected both nationality and country of greatest exposure to capture the cultural context underlying trust and aspiration. Furthermore, the Age options were specifically granulated in the 18–29 range (18–20, 21–24, 25–29) to be statistically optimal for the primary accessible community (university students and young professionals). This finer split was essential for observing nuanced shifts in response within a life stage (e.g., first job, increased disposable income) highly relevant to the study of aspirational e-commerce imagery.

To evaluate the effects of image style, several statistical methods were applied. An independent-samples t-test was used to compare Version A (studio images) and Version B (lifestyle images) for each construct. A paired-samples t-test was conducted to examine within-respondent product bias between Lamps and Glasses under each image condition. In addition, one-way ANOVA tests were used to assess demographic influences, including Gender, Age, Nationality, and Most Exposed Country (MEC). All tests were evaluated at a significance threshold of p < 0.05.

## Results  [_Present and analyse the data collected using appropriate statistical or analytical methods. Include relevant data visualizations and explain their significance_]

Lifestyle imagery produced several notable effects on participant perceptions across Engagement, Trust, and Information Clarity, although these effects varied by product type. Overall, Version B (lifestyle imagery) tended to increase Engagement and make the images appear clearer, while Version A (studio imagery) maintained a slight advantage in perceived Trustworthiness.

For H1, the results showed that lifestyle imagery significantly increased Engagement for the Glasses product (p = 0.0246), whereas the Lamp product displayed a smaller, nonsignificant increase. This pattern indicates that lifestyle imagery can enhance engagement, but its impact depends on the product. Since only the Glasses score reached statistical significance, the null hypothesis is partially rejected: lifestyle images do improve engagement, but the effect is not consistent enough across both products to fully reject H₀. This offers partial support for H₁.

In contrast, H2, covering purchase-related perceptions (Trust and Information Clarity), was not supported by the statistical results. Information Clarity scores were generally higher under lifestyle imagery, but not significantly so, while Trust was slightly higher for studio images, suggesting that minimalistic visuals still convey credibility more effectively. Because neither construct produced statistically significant differences (p > 0.05), the null hypothesis cannot be rejected for H₂. Although the trends indicate meaningful directional differences, the evidence is insufficient to confirm that lifestyle imagery significantly improves purchase-related perceptions.

Additional analyses showed that Lamps were consistently rated more positively than Glasses across several constructs. Specifically, in Version A (Studio images), Lamps received significantly higher scores for Engagement, Trust, and Information Clarity, while in Version B (Lifestyle images), Lamps again scored higher for Trust and Information Clarity, though the Engagement difference was not statistically significant. This pattern indicates a product-specific bias favoring Lamps, independent of image style. Demographic effects were minimal: Gender and Most Exposed Country significantly influenced Information Clarity, while Nationality and Age showed no significant differences. These findings suggest that although certain participant characteristics affect how easily product images are interpreted, they do not alter the broader pattern of results.

Overall, the data demonstrate selective advantages of lifestyle imagery particularly in boosting engagement for certain products while studio imagery retains strengths in perceived trustworthiness. The mixed significance pattern aligns with partial support for H₁ and no statistical support for H₂, highlighting that the effectiveness of lifestyle imagery is context-dependent rather than universal.

Meanwhile, the blue bars (Version A) remain marginally higher for Trust, reflecting the credibility advantage of the studio-style imagery.

## Discussion [_Synthesize your results, citing min. five (5) sources and authors; discuss the implications of your findings; and critically assess the research. Address any limitations, biases, or challenges faced_]

As accordance to Li, Wang and Chen (2014), product images are one of the primary channels for online consumers to assess the quality and the design of the products. Moreover, it has been also examined that pictures containing social presence signals, especially human models, not only tend to increase customer’s trust and intention to purchase but also, appearance of human images would make brand websites more trustworthy. However, based on our survey results, even though life-style pictures outperformed across most concepts specially for engagement and information clarity, trust score was slightly higher for studio images. For both products, participants rated studio-styled images more trustworthy than lifestyle images. Therefore, it is worth to note that this might be dependent on the type of products. Additionally, the reason behind this uncorrelation could be related to the quality of pictures. In fact, studio images would provide clearer presentations which would satisfy customers from the quality point of view. 

On the other hand, Maier and Dost (2018) cited as opposed to a plain white backgrounds, product images with a fitting contextual background contributes to consumers mental imaginary and helps them to engage more with the product. Furthermore, images with plain backgrounds do not provide necessary clues regarding how it would fit or how consumers can utilize it. In fact, this would give customers a chance to have a clear understanding of size, shape and function. Accordingly, a report (Komolov, 2025) conducted to analyze the reason for high return rates also suggests that one of the primary reasons for high returns is incorrect expectations regarding size, fitness and quality. Therefore, using life-style images would minimize such risks of these cases. According to Wang et al. (2021), product photos that contains dynamic or rich-context can help buyers visualize the product more widely, which can contribute to their purchase intention. Additionally, when a product is demonstrsated in a way that matches its actual use, people are more likely to have positive opinions of it and to be less confused. In addition, Kim and Sullivan (2019) claim that consumers are more likely to engage with a brand when its visual presentation stimulates emotions, experiences, and authenticity. Since lifestyle images let buyers to have an imaginary view of the products, they usually generate more engagement than simple studio photos. These findings would support the results of our survey in which both products had higher votes for lifestyle images compared to studio images. 

Furthermore, there were a few limitations with our project that could have affected the results. Firstly, time scope was very short therefore sample size stayed relatively small. The age group mostly ranged between 21-29 and no answer received for people over 39 which means the results may not fully reflect all group of online shoppers. Moreover, only two different products- lamps and sunglasses were presented however, the results might not apply for all product categories. Having more time range and resources could give us a chance to test more items and collect more balanced and wide responses.

There are also some potential biases to be considered. Since the survey was based on self-reported opinions, the results might not be same for actual purchasing activity. People usually act differently on purchasing websites than what they answer on questionnaires. Furthermore, participants have different preferences for products regardless of the image styles. 

Besides biases and limitations, we had some challenges as well. The primary challenge could be not being able to test our survey on a real website that would have provide more accurate data. Finding variety of participants from different demographics and age groups could be another challenge. The majority of the participants were from Hungary or Azerbaijan and between 21-29 ages, which had an impact on the sample's diversity as well. 

## Recommendations  [_Summarise the key insights from the project and suggest specific, actionable business or real-world applications. Where relevant, prioritise your recommendations and explain their expected impact_]

In conclusion, based on the findings, product image styles have a significant impact on customer intention. The average scores for engagement and information clarity were higher for lifestyle photos. ATherefore, pictures of products with real-life content help buyers visualize it better, comprehend their dimensions or function, and feel more secure about their assessment. While age, nationality, and geographic location did not significantly affect the results, gender was the only demographic factor that had a significant impact where female respondents had higher overall purchase intention. 

Based on the findings, several recommendations could be made for e-commerce businesses. Firstly, since lifestyle images help customers to establish more realistic expectations regarding size, fitness and function, retailers should give priority to having lifestyle photos in addition to studio pictures. Secondly, lifestyle images can be especially helpful for products where their dimensions or use is not immediately apparent. This can help to minimize customer confusion and possible returns. Lastly, business should also have studio-style images as it can also support customer trust.

## Reflection on Team Process 

We successfully used collaborative features of GitHub by creating brunches and pull requests and then merging them. Teamwork and collaboration went smoothly with team members being equally involved and supportive of each other. We implemented Agile methodologies by having sprint meetings where we distributed our roles, goals, and deadlines and documented it. We had quick standups/calls where we solved occurring problems if someone was stuck or needed guidance with GitHub. Majority of communication was done through Teams calls and group chat. Before first call, we agreed to do literature review on the topic individually and during the call we distributed research report sections we are responsible for. However, soon enough after the call, we noticed that the writing cannot be coordinated well before we design the survey and collect data, hence there was another call organized during which we did iteration of our plans and redistributed tasks according to both functions and writing sections. Akmaral took responsibility for designing the survey, writing methodology section, guiding the GitHub use, as well as documenting and guiding the team process. The function of performing the analysis and writing results was agreed to be taken by Atilla. And Aydan helped to finish writing the report collecting references, finalizing the document and preparing presentation slides.
