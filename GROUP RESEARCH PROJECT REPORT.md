## Introduction
Online shopping is becoming more frequent and valuable as a result of the growth in the number of people using the Internet on a daily basis. Consequently, majority of the companies paying more attention on the pictures of products to advertise on their websites. However, nowadays picture styles became more complex and require more deep understanding of human psychology. The following report analyses the team's collaboration on the joint UX analytics project- “Product Image Style and Purchase Intent”. The main aim of the research was to examine how product photo styles can influence consumers' attitudes including intention to purchase and trust for the brand, towards online shopping. A picture of the product in use and an image of the product on an ordinary background were the two varieties of images that were compared in the research. Two different gender-natural products- lamps and glasses were selected for the project. The pictures did not contain any brand or logo to ensure to avoid unbiased decisions.
 
Our team collaborated in VistaCommerce company, a global software that provides online retailers with design and optimisation tools and mainly operates in fashion, home goods, and cosmetics industries. In order to assist company’s clients in making better marketing decisions, our team worked on gathering, conducting A/B test and analysing the collected data to measure customer’s engagement with two different types of the pictures. In order to inform the marketing and design decisions, the results will be shared with the Director of Product Design along with key client stakeholders.


## Methodology
The experimental methodology was executed via two survey variants, A and B, distributed through an online platform among accessible communities(university,workplace,etc), with respondent assignment managed by a randomizer tool on [nimblelinks.com]. This approach was a pragmatic alternative to utilizing a live retailer platform, prioritizing internal validity by isolating the image style as the sole manipulated variable while measuring operationalized metrics using Likert scales. To control for the inherent product bias, two distinct product categories—a table lamp (home goods) and sunglasses (fashion)—were assessed. The use of dual products allowed for an evaluation of whether visual perception effects vary significantly across product categories, with both products presented identically across all non-image variables. Although respondents were asked to assume favorable conditions (design fit, fair price) to control for confounding variables, two different products were used to obtain richer results that account for, and potentially isolate, the residual effect of product-specific bias.

The assessment itself was streamlined, utilizing only six focused rating statements per product on a 5-point scale (1 = Strongly Disagree to 5 = Strongly Agree) to ensure high completion rates. These statements measured three core factors: Engagement (E-1: attention capture, E-2: imaginative ownership), Perceived Trust (PT-1: confidence in real-life appearance, PT-2: reliability perception), and Purchase Intent (PI-1: motivation to seek price/reviews, PI-2: likelihood of selection). 

Demographically, gender was included as a control variable due to its established influence in visual perception studies. Geographic data collected both nationality and country of greatest exposure to capture the cultural context underlying trust and aspiration. Furthermore, the Age options were specifically granulated in the 18–29 range (18–20, 21–24, 25–29) to be statistically optimal for the primary accessible community (university students and young professionals). This finer split was essential for observing nuanced shifts in response within a life stage (e.g., first job, increased disposable income) highly relevant to the study of aspirational e-commerce imagery.

## Discussion

As accordance to Li, Wang and Chen (2014), image of the products are one of the main channels for online consumers to assess the quality and the design of the products. Moreover, it has been also examined that pictures containing social presence signals, especially human models, not only tend to increase customer’s trust and intention to purchase but also, appearance of human images would make brand websites more trustworthy. However, based on the survey results, even though life-style pictures outperformed across most concepts specially for engagement and information clarity, trust score was much higher for studio images. For both of the products, participants rated studio-styled images moderately more trustworthy than lifestyle images. Therefore, it can be noted that this might be dependent on the type of products. The reason behind this uncorrelation could be related to the quality of pictures. In fact, studio images would provide clearer presentations which would satisfy customers from the quality point of view. 

On the other hand, Maier and Dost (2018) cited product images with a fitting contextual background, as opposed to a plain white background contributes to consumers mental imaginary and helps them to engage more with the product. Furthermore, images with plain backgrounds do not provide necessary clues regarding how it would fit or how consumers can utilize it. In fact, this would give customers a chance to have a clear understanding of size, shape and function. Accordingly, a report (Komolov, 2025) conducted to analyze the reason for high return rates also suggests that one of the primary reasons for high returns is incorrect expectations regarding size, fitness and quality. Therefore, the usage of life-style images would eliminate such risks of these cases. According to Wang et al. (2021), product photos with dynamic or context-rich images can help buyers visualize the product more vividly, which can contribute on purchase intention. Based on their findings, when a product is presented in a way that matches its actual use, people are more likely to have positive opinions of it and to be less unsure about it. In addition, Kim and Sullivan (2019) claim that consumers are more likely to engage with a brand when its visual presentation stimulates emotions, experiences, and authenticity. Since lifestyle images enable buyers to have an imagined view, they generate greater engagement than plain studio photos. These findings would support the results of our survey in which both products had higher votes for lifestyle images compared to studio images.
